/// The candidates are: kExtraStatePlaying for obvious reasons,
/// kExtraStateNormal when there is nothing extra and last
/// but not least, kExtraStateActive which is basically just
/// a paused but fully loaded song.
///
/// When setting extra state, we assign it to every single
/// column in that row to make sure it can redraw itself properly.
///
/// Additionally, we show or hide an layer on top of the row
/// that allows us to show an extra symbol on the very left side.
/// Note that we need to assert that the first item in the row does
/// allow for some space for this.
